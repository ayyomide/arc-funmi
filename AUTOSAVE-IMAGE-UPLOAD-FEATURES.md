# Autosave and Improved Image Upload Features

## Overview

This update adds robust autosave functionality and improved image upload handling to prevent users from losing their work when articles fail to publish or image uploads fail.

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. Autosave System

#### What it does:
- **Automatic saving**: Saves article drafts every 30 seconds to both localStorage and Supabase
- **Recovery on page refresh**: If users refresh the page, they can recover their unsaved work
- **Dual storage**: Uses both localStorage (immediate) and Supabase (persistent) for maximum reliability
- **Smart saving**: Only saves when there's actual content (title or content)

#### How it works:
- **localStorage**: Immediate backup that works even offline
- **Supabase**: Persistent storage that survives browser clearing
- **Recovery dialog**: Shows when unsaved changes are detected
- **Time tracking**: Shows when the last save occurred

#### User Experience:
```
User types → Autosave every 30s → Page refresh → Recovery dialog → Restore content
```

### 2. Improved Image Upload

#### What it does:
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time upload progress with visual feedback
- **Cancellation**: Users can cancel uploads that are taking too long
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages with retry options
- **Preview**: Immediate image preview while uploading
- **Upload status**: Clear indication of upload success/failure

#### Features:
- ✅ **Cancel uploads**: Click the X button to cancel during upload
- ✅ **Progress bar**: Visual progress indicator
- ✅ **Error recovery**: Dismiss errors and try again
- ✅ **Success confirmation**: Green checkmark when upload completes
- ✅ **File validation**: Supports JPG, PNG, GIF up to 5MB

## 📁 New Files

### 1. `lib/autosave.ts`
- **AutosaveService**: Singleton service managing autosave functionality
- **localStorage integration**: Immediate backup storage
- **Supabase integration**: Persistent draft storage
- **Recovery system**: Draft recovery and restoration

### 2. `components/ui/image-upload.tsx`
- **ImageUpload component**: Reusable image upload with progress
- **Cancellation support**: AbortController for upload cancellation
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time upload progress
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error states

### 3. `app/test-autosave/page.tsx`
- **Test page**: Simple form to test autosave functionality
- **Recovery testing**: Easy way to test draft recovery

## 🔧 Updated Files

### 1. `app/write-article/page.tsx`
- **Autosave integration**: Uses AutosaveService for automatic saving
- **Recovery dialog**: Shows when unsaved changes are detected
- **New image upload**: Uses the improved ImageUpload component
- **Status indicators**: Shows last saved time and upload status

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### For Users:
1. **Never lose work**: Automatic saving prevents data loss
2. **Recovery on refresh**: Can recover work after page refresh
3. **Better uploads**: Cancel long uploads and retry
4. **Clear feedback**: Know when saves/uploads are happening
5. **Offline support**: localStorage works even without internet

### For Developers:
1. **Modular design**: AutosaveService can be reused
2. **Error resilience**: Graceful handling of network issues
3. **Performance**: Efficient saving with debouncing
4. **Testing**: Dedicated test page for functionality

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Autosave:
1. Go to `/test-autosave`
2. Type some content
3. Wait 30 seconds for autosave
4. Refresh the page
5. Click "Recover Draft" to restore content

### Test Image Upload:
1. Go to `/write-article`
2. Upload an image
3. Watch progress bar
4. Try canceling during upload
5. See success confirmation

## 🔄 How Autosave Works

```typescript
// Every 30 seconds:
1. Check if form has content
2. Save to localStorage (immediate)
3. If user authenticated, save to Supabase (persistent)
4. Update last saved timestamp
5. Show status indicator
```

## 🖼️ How Image Upload Works

```typescript
// When user selects image:
1. Show immediate preview
2. Start upload with progress tracking
3. Allow cancellation via AbortController
4. Show progress bar and status
5. Complete with success/error feedback
```

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Autosave Errors:
- **localStorage fails**: Continue with Supabase only
- **Supabase fails**: Continue with localStorage only
- **Both fail**: Show error but don't block user

### Image Upload Errors:
- **Network timeout**: Allow retry
- **File too large**: Clear error message
- **Upload cancelled**: Reset state cleanly
- **Server error**: Show specific error message

## 📊 Performance Considerations

- **Debounced saving**: Only saves when content changes
- **Efficient storage**: Minimal localStorage usage
- **Background uploads**: Don't block UI during uploads
- **Cleanup**: Clear storage after successful publish

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. **Auto-recovery**: Automatically recover on page load
2. **Version history**: Multiple draft versions
3. **Collaborative editing**: Real-time collaboration
4. **Advanced uploads**: Drag & drop, multiple files
5. **Offline mode**: Full offline article editing

## 🎉 Summary

This update significantly improves the user experience by:
- **Preventing data loss** through automatic saving
- **Improving upload reliability** with cancellation and progress
- **Providing clear feedback** on all operations
- **Enabling recovery** from unexpected page refreshes

Users can now write articles with confidence, knowing their work is automatically saved and can be recovered if needed!
